# Static Node.js and Express Site

This project is Unit 06 of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. 

The Static Node.js and Express Site is a personal site devoted to showcasing the projects I have built while progressing through the Full Stack Techdegree program and any personal projects. The site was built using Node.js and Express.js.  


## In Addition to the Provided Project Files and their Content
* The package.json file is configured so that running "npm start" while in the directory will run the app. "npm start" will install any package dependecies and will start the server. 

* Error handling middleware has been configured in such a way as to render a an "error.pug" html template. The template will include information regarding the Error Status Code, an Error Message, and the Stack trace. This html error page will be in addition to a messaged logged to the node.js console.

### Custom Style Changes Applied
* Switched the font to "Montserrat"
* On the "about" page, altered the styling of the "Skills", "Contact Info", and "Connect" features.
* Included a linear-gradient along the sidebar when the browser window is maximized or when the navigation menu option is selected.
* For each "project" page, altered the styling of the "Technologies" and the "Live Demo" and "GitHub Repo" buttons.
