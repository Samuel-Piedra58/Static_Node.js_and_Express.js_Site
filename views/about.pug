            |For my day job I am an RPA Developer (Robotics Process Automation) and spend my time building automated solutions for rote, repetitive, and ready-for-automation business processes. After my day job and on the weekends I am honing my developer skills through Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. In this techdegree I have learned and applied client-side and server-side JavaScript to build fun and user-friendly applications and features. You can better see the skills I have gained from the panel on the right and you can check out my work here through this site or on my github.

I am also an avid football fan (I mean soccer...) and follow and support Chelsea Football Club.
