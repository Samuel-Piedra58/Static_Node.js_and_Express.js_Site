        | Welcome to my first development portfolio! Here you will find the projects I have thus far created in my budding JavaScript development efforts. From my first baby client-side project of displaying famous quotes across the screen (oh "setTimeout" how you intimidated me...) to this current static website running on Node.js and using Express and Pug.

      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to create a project img, title and link in the markup for each of the projects you are showcasing.  
      
      //- Use a combination of interpolation and template literals as needed to dynamically generate the the routes in the href, as well as the img's src and the projects title.
      
      //- Here's what the Pug for each project example should look like.

        a(href='#')
          img.thumbnail(src='https://placehold.it/550x550')
