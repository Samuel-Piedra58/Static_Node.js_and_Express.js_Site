      "description": "List pagination is the application of breaking out data (like a list of people, posts, or product items) across pages for the user to toggle between instead of scrolling. List pagination provides the user the ability to view data in increments of 10 or 20 items per page, instead of having them scroll endlessly. This project also offers a filtering feature allowing the user to search for a specific list item by name. Building pagination and filterting helped test and solidify my knowledge regarding basic JavaScript syntax, Web API's, and friendly user features.",
